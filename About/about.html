    <p>My name is Neo Mthimkulu, I am an aspiring Software Engineer. At this point I cannot say what I specialize in </br>
        but I do know I really like web development. Its fun and challenging at times but the challenge feels rewarding so I like it.</br>
    </p>
    <p>I also love software development. It's creative, and constantly evolving.</br> 
        There's always something new to learn and a new problem to solve. </br>
        Despite the challenges that development presents it always feels like magic when you press F5 and everything runs smoothly after a week of </br>
        racking your brain fixing bugs
